nzbapp

This is a project for building a Turnkey Linux patch to configure a
Turnkey Linux installation of Ubuntu 10.04 (initially) along with the following additions:

- SABnzbd
- CouchPotato (for locating NZB files for movies)
- Sickbeard (for locating NZB files for TV shows)

in the futures, we may choose to add

- Headphones (for locating NZB files for music releases)
- newznab (nzb indexing software)


NOTES
==================================================================
nzbapp is configured as follows:
- complete and incomplete dinaries are being placed in /srv/storage
  if additional space is needed, it may be best to either create
  an LVM at initial installtion time OR add a second disk to the 
  installation, create a filesystem and mount it on /srv/storage
- You must run through the SABnzbd setup wizard at:
      http://<ipaddress>:8080
- Note that SABnzbd will generate some API keys upon initial startup.
  These keys must be specified in the Sickbeard and CouchPotato configuration 
  screens for NZB files to be successfully sent between applications


DONATIONS
==================================================================
If you want to send donations to keep this work going, please send them to
the authours of SABnzbd, CouchPotato, SickBeard and/or Turnkey Linux.
They are the heroes in this effort, not me.
